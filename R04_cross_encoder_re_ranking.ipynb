    "Two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Re-ranking a long tail of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. For a query we retrieve a list of 10 documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. We then create pairs of query and each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Then we ask th encoder to re-rank these pairs for relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Re-rank after query expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. We expand the given query with a set of additional queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. We then retrieve 10 documents for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. We remove duplicate documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. We then pair the original query with each of the documents and proceed to scoring them\n",
